# tpsharp
this is a tp! c# library for accessing the public thinkproject REST Api.
You can use this library for managing your projects directly from any .NET application.
This repo will also contain an example of how to use the tp! Api through Autodesk's Dynamo (R) with Zero Touch Nodes.

- Username: username to connect with
- Password: matching password
- AppKey: your tp! App Key
